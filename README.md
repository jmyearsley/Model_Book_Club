Matlab Code for Farrell &amp; Lewandowsky Book

Hi All! 
The purpose of this repository is to host Matlab scripts to replicate the code fragments given in Farrell & Lewandowsky's book 'Computational Modeling of Cognition and Behaviour' that we are working through for the Model Book Club. 

I have tried to write these as 'transliterations', in other words I have kept the structure as close to the R code given in the book as possible. There are more elegant ways to write some of this, but keeping it close to the original should help with following the book. The big exception to that is anything to do with plotting. R and MatLab have very different ideas about plotting, and I've just aimed at reproducing the look of the figures in the book.

NB: For reasons of brevity and laziness, you need to make sure you have the statistics and machine learning toolbox installed in MatLab before you run these scripts. If you dont have this already you can get it via Home -> Add-Ons. 

I hope you find these useful!

# Model_Book_Club â€“ Python

Python Code for Farrell & Lewandowsky Book

This folder contains Python notebooks to replicate the code fragments given in Farrell & Lewandowsky's book *Computational Modeling of Cognition and Behaviour* that we are working through for the Model Book Club.

Like James in his Matlab code, I tried to keep close to the R code, though plotting-related things needed to be modified.

The code is in the form of Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`), which is a format that allows to combine formatted text with Python code and its output, therefore a commented record of a computing session.

To use them (run & modify the code) you need an installation of Python 3 and Jupyter, plus (so far) the packages `numpy`, `bokeh`, `pandas`, `statsmodels`, and `scipy`. The easiest way to get all that is to install the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). If you need help with installation, starting Jupyter etc., let me know!

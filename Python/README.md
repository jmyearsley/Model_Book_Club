# Model_Book_Club â€“ Python

Python Code for Farrell & Lewandowsky Book

This folder contains Python notebooks to replicate the code fragments given in Farrell & Lewandowsky's book *Computational Modeling of Cognition and Behaviour* that we are working through for the Model Book Club.

Like James in his Matlab code, I tried to keep close to the R code, though plotting-related things needed to be modified.

The code is in the form of Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`), which is a format that allows to combine formatted text with Python code and its output, therefore a commented record of a computing session. You may be able to view the notebooks online by clicking on the file name in GitHub, but that doesn't always work.

To use them (run & modify the code) you need an installation of Python 3 and Jupyter, plus (so far) the packages `numpy`, `bokeh`, `pandas`, `statsmodels`, and `scipy`.

To get started quickly, you can use the service Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jmyearsley/Model_Book_Club/HEAD?filepath=Python)
Binder allows to opens notebooks and you can run & modify the code without installing anything locally; I configured it so that all necessary packages are available.

However, Binder often overloaded, so it's better to get Python running on your own computer. The easiest way to get everything necessary is to install the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). If you need help with installation, starting Jupyter etc., let me know!
